        question: `How much can I save on dental implants in Costa Rica?`,
        answer: 'Dental implants in Costa Rica can cost 50-70% less than in the US or Canada. A single dental implant that costs $4,000-$6,000 in North America typically costs $1,200-$2,000 in Costa Rica, including the crown. All-on-4 treatments can save you $15,000-$25,000 or more.',
    },
    {
        question: `Are dental implants in Costa Rica safe and high quality?`,
        answer: `Absolutely. ${siteDetails.siteName} uses the same premium implant brands (Nobel Biocare, Straumann) used in the US and Europe. Our dentists are US-trained with decades of experience, and our facilities meet or exceed international healthcare standards. We provide full documentation and lifetime warranties on our work.`
    },
    {
        question: 'How long do I need to stay in Costa Rica for dental implants?',
        answer: 'The timeline depends on your treatment. Simple procedures like crowns or veneers typically require 5-7 days. Traditional dental implants with bone grafting may need two trips: one for implant placement (5-7 days) and another 3-4 months later for crown placement (3-5 days). All-on-4 immediate load implants can often be completed in a single 7-10 day trip.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What is All-on-4 and how is it different from traditional implants?',
        answer: 'All-on-4 is a revolutionary technique that replaces an entire arch of teeth using just 4 strategically placed dental implants. Unlike traditional implants that require one implant per tooth, All-on-4 provides a full set of fixed teeth in a single procedure. The technique often eliminates the need for bone grafting and allows for immediate loading, meaning you can leave with functional teeth on the same day.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Do you help with travel arrangements and accommodations?',
        answer: 'Yes! We offer complete dental vacation packages that include airport pickup, comfortable accommodations near our clinic, transportation to and from appointments, and assistance with sightseeing activities. Our bilingual staff coordinates everything so you can focus on your treatment and enjoying Costa Rica.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What happens if I have problems after returning home?',
        answer: 'We provide comprehensive follow-up care and lifetime warranties on our dental work. If any issues arise, we work with your local dentist or you can return to Costa Rica for adjustments. We maintain detailed records and are always available via phone, email, or video consultation. Most patients experience no complications, but we stand behind our work completely.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Will my insurance cover dental implants done in Costa Rica?',
        answer: 'Many US and Canadian insurance plans offer some coverage for dental implants regardless of where the procedure is performed. We provide all necessary documentation, invoices, and x-rays for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. Even after insurance and travel costs, most patients still save 40-60% compared to treatment at home.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Am I a good candidate for dental implants?',
        answer: 'Most adults in good general health are candidates for dental implants. Ideal candidates have adequate bone density, healthy gums, and are non-smokers or willing to quit. Conditions like diabetes or osteoporosis require careful evaluation but don\'t automatically disqualify you. We offer free consultations with x-ray review to determine your eligibility and recommend the best treatment plan for your specific situation.',
