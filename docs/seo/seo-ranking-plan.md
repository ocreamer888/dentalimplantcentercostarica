## Phase 1: Technical SEO Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### 1.1 Core Web Vitals Optimization

**Current Issues Identified:**
- Multiple gradient backgrounds may impact paint times
- Loading states suggest potential performance bottlenecks
- Heavy image usage without optimization specifications

**Action Items:**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Target <2.5s
  - Optimize hero images with WebP format and proper sizing
  - Implement critical CSS inlining (already started)
  - Use `loading="lazy"` for below-fold images
  - Preload key resources (fonts, hero images)

- **First Input Delay (FID):** Target <100ms
  - Minimize JavaScript execution time
  - Code-split React components
  - Use `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical tasks

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Target <0.1
  - Define explicit dimensions for all images
  - Reserve space for dynamic content
  - Use CSS `aspect-ratio` for responsive images

### 1.2 Technical Infrastructure

**Immediate Fixes:**
```typescript
// Update next.config.js
module.exports = {
  compress: true,
  poweredByHeader: false,
  generateEtags: false,
  images: {
    domains: ['dentalimplantcentercostarica.com'],
    formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
    minimumCacheTTL: 31536000,
  },
  headers: async () => [
    {
      source: '/(.*)',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
          value: 'nosniff',
        },
        {
          key: 'X-Frame-Options',
          value: 'DENY',
        },
        {
          key: 'X-XSS-Protection',
          value: '1; mode=block',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

**Schema Markup Enhancement:**

### 1.3 URL Structure Optimization

**Recommended URL Expansion:**
